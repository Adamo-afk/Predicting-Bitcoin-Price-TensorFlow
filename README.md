# Predicting Bitcoin price using TensorFlow
This Python project uses time series forecasting practices to predict the price of Bitcoin by leveraging various models, using data collected from October 1, 2013, to May 18, 2021. The proposed approach involves implementing multiple forecasting models, each designed to capture trends exhibited by Bitcoin's price over the specified time range.

One of the models considered for implementation in this project was the N-BEATS algorithm, a cutting-edge deep learning model introduced by Elemental AI. N-BEATS stands out as a pure deep-learning solution, designed to replicate the mechanisms of statistical models. The algorithm achieves this by using double residual stacks of fully connected layers.

N-BEATS, which stands for Neural Basis Expansion Analysis for Time Series, was introduced by Boris Oreshkin, Dmitri Carpov, and Nicolas Chapados in the M4 competition, a forecasting competition organized by the International Institute of Forecasters. The algorithm has a unique architecture which was inspired by the ResNets used in computer vision tasks and aims to capture the hierarchical and non-linear patterns present in time series data.
